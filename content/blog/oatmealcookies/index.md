**bold** Serving Size: 18

**bold** Estimated Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup melted butter
* 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1-2 tbsp honey
* 1-2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 cup old-fashioned whole rolled oats 
* heaping 3/4 cup shredded coconut
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tbsp boiling water
* 1 tsp baking soda

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F and prepare baking trays.
2. Melt the butter in a microwave. Add the brown sugar, honey, maple, and stir to combine. (If you prefer drier cookies, reduce honey and maple to 1 tablespoon each)
3. Add the flour, oats, coconut, optional salt, and stir to combine; set aside.
4. In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the water and heat on high power to boil, about 1 minute. Slowly and very carefully add the baking soda to the water. Use caution because it will bubble up vigorously. Stir to dissolve the baking soda. 
5. Pour water-baking soda mixture over dough and stir to combine. Dough will look like streusel topping. Fluffy and loose, but when squeezed together, compacts to form a dough.
6. Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping two tablespoon mounds. Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds about halfway with your palm. (Optional: refridgerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days).
7. Bake for about 9 minutes, or until edges have set and will be just beginning to brown (the coconut in the dough is prone to burning so watch them) and the tops are just beginning to set, even if undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. Do not bake longer than 9 to 10 minutes for soft cookies because they firm up as they cool; bake for 10 to 12 minutes if you like firmer, crisper cookies.
8. Store in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week or in freezer for 4 months. Unbaked cookie dough lasts in refrigerator for 5 days and in freezer for 4 months.
