**Serving Size:** 15-18 Macaroons

**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup shredded coconut 
* 4 tsp sweetened condensed milk (approximately)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Melted chocolate chips for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F and prepare baking tray.
2. In a bowl, place the shredded coconut. Add sweetened condensed milk, *one teaspoon at a time*. The amount of condensed milk should really be eye-balled. You should put just enough so that the coconut flakes can stick together and form a ball.
3. Using a mini ice cream scooper or tablespoon measure, scoop balls of the mixture onto the baking tray.
4. Bake for about 10 minutes or until the macaroons are golden brown. If the bottom of the macaroons are beginning to burn, turn off the oven and broil for about 2-3 minutes until desired golden brown color is achieved.
5. Let cool completely. Melt chocolate chips and drizzle on top. Chill in fridge. Enjoy!
