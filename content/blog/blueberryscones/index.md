**Serving Size:** 8 scones

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

## Ingredients

*Scones* 
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* Pinch of salt
* 3 tbsp cold butter
* 3 tbsp sour cream
* 3 tbsp heavy cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2/3 cup fresh or frozen blueberries

*Streusel Topping*
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp sugar (a little less will do)
* 1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
* Pinch of cinnamon
* 1 tbsp softened butter (a little less will do)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400F and prepare a lined, nonstick baking sheet. 
2. In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to allow dry ingredients to become cold. The colder the ingredients, the softer and flakier the scones will become. 
3. In the meantime, grab the butter and cut into small pieces. The smaller the better.
4. Take out the dry ingredients from the freezer and add the cold and cut butter. Mash evenly until the mixture feels like sand.
5. Add the sour cream, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Mix with fork. Dough should begin to thicken.
6. Fold in the blueberries. Some of them may get squashed because of the stiff dough-- don't panic. 
7. Form the dough into a small disk no more than 1 inch tall. Place in fridge for 30 minutes. Spend this time making the streusel topping. In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until the mixture is loosely sticking together. 
8. Take the dough out of the fridge and place onto your baking sheet. Lightly press the streusel topping into the top.
9. Cut the dough into the pieces, retaining the overall disk appearance. Space out enough to allow scones to expand. I separated them by about 1/2 inch. 
10. Bake at 400F for about 30 minutes or until scones look golden brown.
