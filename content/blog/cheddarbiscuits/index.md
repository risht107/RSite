**Serving Size:** 10 mini biscuits (about 1.5in x 1.5in)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tbsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 3 tbsp cold and cut butter
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* flax egg (2 tsp flax meal + 5 tsp water, let sit for 10 mins until goopy)
* heaping 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* heaping 1 1/2 tbsp finely chopped chives

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400F and prepare a lined, nonstick baking sheet. 
2. In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. 
3. Cut the butter into small pieces and ensure it is cold. Add the butter and grind into the dry ingredients. Should result in a course mixture, almost like sand.  
4. Make a well and add the heavy cream and flax egg. Mix with fork until *almost* combined. Add the cheese and chives. Finish mixing the dough until fully combined. It should come together and form one giant ball. 
5. Form the dough into a square/rectangular shape about 1 inch thick. Cut into even pieces and place on baking sheet. Bake for 14 minutes or until golden brown. Keep close watch!
6. Additional herb topping:
  + In a bowl, mix 1.5 tbsp melted butter, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and chili flakes (eye ball all of it to your liking)
  + Evenly spread on all warm biscuits to add extra flavor!
